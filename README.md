Step-by-Step Python Projects for Beginners üêç

This project is a collection of step-by-step Python projects I created over years while teaching teenagers how to code. It's designed to help beginners:
- Learn Python syntax and concepts 
- Apply knowledge through practical mini-projects 
- Strengthen problem-solving skills 

This file contains:
- Hands-on projects for each chapter
- Problem sets to test understanding

Each section builds upon the previous one. It‚Äôs perfect for self-learners, classroom use, or bootcamp-style instruction.
